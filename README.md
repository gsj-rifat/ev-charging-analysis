# Electric Vehicle Charging Session Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of electric vehicle charging session data. The goal of this project was to explore the provided dataset and answer specific questions related to charging patterns and user behavior.

## Project Overview

The project involves the analysis of data related to EV charging sessions, including:

* Total charged energy
* Number of active EVSEs per week
* Behavioral differences between user types (Normal, Roaming, Ad Hoc)
* Distribution of one-phase and three-phase charging sessions
* Histogram of maximum charging power per session

The data consists of charging session information and, for most sessions, corresponding meter readings.
As the data is from a company and real world data, the data is confidential.
